# The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting every aspect of our daily lives. 
One of the key challenges in managing this crisis is predicting the spread of the virus, so that public health officials can take appropriate measures to contain it. 
In this project, we have used Google Trends data to predict COVID-19 cases in different regions of France. 
Google Trends provides a wealth of information about people's search behavior, which can be used as a proxy for their level of concern about the virus. 
By analyzing Google search data for specific keywords related to COVID-19, we have been able to identify patterns in people's search behavior that are closely correlated with the spread of the virus. 
We have then used these patterns to build predictive models that can forecast COVID-19 cases in different regions of France.
We hope that the insights gained from this project can be used to support public health officials in their efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and to minimize its impact on people's lives.
